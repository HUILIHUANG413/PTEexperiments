        </h4>
        <p>
            The text contains numerous effective and meaningful information for people. How to learn the meaning of words is a critical prerequisite for many machine learning tasks. Traditionally, people represent words independently to each other and represent each
            document as a "bag of words". However, the sparsity, polysemy, and synonymy of words and documents are commonly ignored during training.
        </p>
        <p>
            One way to deal with it is by representing words and documents in low-dimensional spaces[1]. By the unsupervised learning process, the similar words and documents are embedded closely to each other. For example, Mikilov et al. proposed Skip-gram using
            the embedding of the target words to predict the embedding of individual context word in a local window. [1]. Compared with other classical approaches that utilize the distributional similarity of word contest, this text embedding approach
            is more efficient and easier to deploy[2].
        </p>
        <p>
            However, compared with deep learning approaches such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the precision of text embedding method would be lower. This is because a method like CNNs leverage labeled information thus they can learn the representation
            of the data better. In other words, the unsupervised method would be generalizable for a different task but have weaker predictive power for a particular task[2]. However, compared with text embedding, CNNs training also has a drawback. It
            requires numerous parameters which is not only time consuming but also difficult to train an ideal model.
        </p>
        <p>
            To sum up, text embedding methods are more efficient while deep learning neural networks are more predictive. How about using both supervised and unsupervised labels at the same time?
        </p>

        </h4>
        <p>
            In this project, we deploy Predictive Text Embedding (PTE), a semi-supervised representation learning method for text data to fill the gap between supervised and unsupervised labels. By learning from limited labeled examples and a large number of unlabelled
            examples, we obtain an effective low dimensional representation, which is the information between words and words, words and labels and words and documents.
        </p>
        <p>
            We build two kinds of training data: one has a network encodes different levels of co-occurrence information between words and words while other does not. Then, we conduct experiments with sentiment data sets MR, short document data sets DBLP and long
            document data sets 20NG. Experimental results show that the data which has the word and word information outperform the data without this embedding information in various text classification tasks.

        </h3>
        <p>
            In semi-supervised sentence classification, to leverage both annotated data and unannotated text data, we first build a heterogeneous graph whose edge consists of word-sentence, word-word, and word-label. Then we learn the representations of each vertex
            in the graph. Finally, we could use them as input of the text classification task. This framework is proposed by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.00200">Tang et al.</a>. There are several methods we would like to try in the
            second step. The first is to use <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.00200">PTE</a> training process. The second is to use <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907">Graph Convolutional Networks ( GCN )</a>. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05679">Yao et al.</a>            has tried GCN in the text classification task, but they did not include existing labels as vertices in the graph. We argue that label vertices are crucial, because it can introduce supervised information when training word embeddings. Because
            of the heterogeneity, we would like to try techniques in Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network. We plan to use three datasets to test our model: <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/">one movie review dataset</a> and
            two sentiment classification datasets: <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdredze/datasets/sentiment/">Multi-Domain Sentiment Dataset (version 2.0)</a>, <a href="http://thinknook.com/twitter-sentiment-analysis-training-corpus-dataset-2012-09-22/">Twitter Sentiment Analysis Training Corpus (Dataset)</a>.

            We will be able to determine the approach with the best performance using the three datasets and the contribution of labeled and unlabeled data in semi-supervised learning to the final result, as well as the efficiency and the parameter used. Finally,
            we also present document visualizations to vividly illustrate our result.

        </h3>
        <p>
            PTE relates the unlabeled training data directly to the specific task, outperforming methods that train word/semantic embedding separately. Thus, we expect that utilizing recent advancements in graph-based neural network structure and traning method like
            proposed in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907">Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks</a> can further enhance PTE method. We also expect that techniques in Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network like
            attention mechanism will improve our performance in this project because of our heterogeneous construction of graph and the nature of text analysis task.

a fascinating examination of the joyous , turbulent self-discovery made by a proper , middle-aged woman .
the rock has a great presence but one battle after another is not the same as one battle followed by killer cgi effects .
it's crap on a leash--far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of joe dante's similarly styled gremlins .
a full-frontal attack on audience patience .
basically a static series of semi-improvised ( and semi-coherent ) raps between the stars .
so routine , familiar and predictable , it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated final draft computer program .
a benign but forgettable sci-fi diversion .
[barry] gives assassin a disquieting authority .

this isn't a terrible film by any means , but it's also far from being a realized work .
a gorgeous , high-spirited musical from india that exquisitely blends music , dance , song , and high drama .

the film is a verbal duel between two gifted performers .
the movie makes absolutely no sense . its underlying mythology is a hodgepodge of inconsistencies that pose the question : since when did dumb entertainment have to be this dumb ?
delivers the same old same old , tarted up with latin flava and turned out by hollywood playas .
for the most part , i spy was an amusing lark that will probably rank as one of murphy's better performances in one of his lesser-praised movies .
tully is worth a look for its true-to-life characters , its sensitive acting , its unadorned view of rural life and the subtle direction of first-timer hilary birmingham .
it's a bittersweet and lyrical mix of elements .
you'll end up moved .
a puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks .
not just unlikable . disturbing . disgusting . without any redeeming value whatsoever .
essentially , the film is weak on detail and strong on personality
the best movie in many a moon about the passions that sometimes fuel our best achievements and other times leave us stranded with nothing more than our lesser appetites .
[serry] wants to blend politics and drama , an admirable ambition . it's too bad that the helping hand he uses to stir his ingredients is also a heavy one .
co-writer/director jonathan parker's attempts to fashion a brazil-like , hyper-real satire fall dreadfully short .
for all its plot twists , and some of them verge on the bizarre as the film winds down , blood work is a strong , character-oriented piece .
it's tough being a black man in america , especially when the man has taken away your car , your work-hours and denied you health insurance .
world traveler might not go anywhere new , or arrive anyplace special , but it's certainly an honest attempt to get at something .
a macabre and very stylized swedish fillm about a modern city where all the religious and civic virtues that hold society in place are in tatters .
despite its title , punch-drunk love is never heavy-handed . the jabs it employs are short , carefully placed and dead-center .
' . . . both hokey and super-cool , and definitely not in a hurry , so sit back , relax and have a few laughs while the little ones get a fuzzy treat . '
an earnest racial-issues picture that might have gotten respectful critical praise in a different era -- say , the '60s .
when twentysomething hotsies make movies about their lives , hard-driving narcissism is a given , but what a world we'd live in if argento's hollywood counterparts . . . had this much imagination and nerve .
theology aside , why put someone who ultimately doesn't learn at the center of a kids' story ?
the movie is not as terrible as the synergistic impulse that created it .
an uncluttered , resonant gem that relays its universal points without lectures or confrontations .
reign of fire looks as if it was made without much thought -- and is best watched that way .
one minute , you think you're watching a serious actioner ; the next , it's as though clips from the pink panther strikes again and/or sailor moon have been spliced in .
a poignant and gently humorous parable that loves its characters and communicates something rather beautiful about human nature .
the wanton slipperiness of * corpus and its amiable jerking and reshaping of physical time and space would make it a great piece to watch with kids and use to introduce video as art .
almost peerlessly unsettling .
. . . a thoughtful what-if for the heart as well as the mind .
exquisitely acted and masterfully if preciously interwoven [the film] addresses in a fascinating , intelligent manner the intermingling of race , politics and local commerce .
high crimes is a cinematic misdemeanor , a routine crime thriller remarkable only for its lack of logic and misuse of two fine actors , morgan freeman and ashley judd .
richard gere and diane lane put in fine performances as does french actor oliver martinez .
better at putting you to sleep than a sound machine .
adolescents will be adequately served by the movie's sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick , although the more lascivious-minded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a 'topless tutorial service . '
louiso lets the movie dawdle in classic disaffected-indie-film mode , and brother hoffman's script stumbles over a late-inning twist that just doesn't make sense .
the director and her capable cast appear to be caught in a heady whirl of new age-inspired good intentions , but the spell they cast isn't the least bit mesmerizing .
splendidly illustrates the ability of the human spirit to overcome adversity .
bad company . bad movie . just plain bad .
cold and scattered , minority report commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals . that's not vintage spielberg and that , finally , is minimally satisfying .
the skirmishes for power waged among victims and predators settle into an undistinguished rhythm of artificial suspense .
it tends to remind one of a really solid woody allen film , with its excellent use of new york locales and sharp writing
a movie with a real anarchic flair .
worth a look as a curiosity .
it's never a good sign when a film's star spends the entirety of the film in a coma . it's a worse sign when you begin to envy her condition .
a lean , deftly shot , well-acted , weirdly retro thriller that recalls a raft of '60s and '70s european-set spy pictures .
between bedroom scenes , viewers may find themselves wishing they could roll over and take a nap .
this is a movie where the most notable observation is how long you've been sitting still .
i have no way of knowing exactly how much is exaggeration , but i've got a creepy feeling that the film is closer to the mark than i want to believe .
. . . one resurrection too many .
writer-director david jacobson and his star , jeremy renner , have made a remarkable film that explores the monster's psychology not in order to excuse him but rather to demonstrate that his pathology evolved from human impulses that grew hideously twisted .
director-writer bille august . . . depicts this relationship with economical grace , letting his superb actors convey martin's deterioration and barbara's sadness -- and , occasionally , anger .
'abandon all hope , ye who enter here' . . . you should definitely let dante's gloomy words be your guide .
one hour photo may seem disappointing in its generalities , but it's the little nuances that perhaps had to escape from director mark romanek's self-conscious scrutiny to happen , that finally get under your skin .
none of his actors stand out , but that's less of a problem here than it would be in another film : characterization matters less than atmosphere .
weird . rewarding .
has all the hallmarks of a movie designed strictly for children's home video , a market so insatiable it absorbs all manner of lame entertainment , as long as 3-year-olds find it diverting .
the best animated feature to hit theaters since beauty and the beast 11 years ago .
a well-intentioned effort that's still too burdened by the actor's offbeat sensibilities for the earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree of accessibility .
mr . deeds is not really a film as much as it is a loose collection of not-so-funny gags , scattered moments of lazy humor .
it's burns' visuals , characters and his punchy dialogue , not his plot , that carry waydowntown .
neither as scary-funny as tremors nor demented-funny as starship troopers , the movie isn't tough to take as long as you've paid a matinee price .
the film thrusts the inchoate but already eldritch christian right propaganda machine into national media circles .
though it goes further than both , anyone who has seen the hunger or cat people will find little new here , but a tasty performance from vincent gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary .
what lifts the film high above run-of-the-filth gangster flicks is its refusal to recognise any of the signposts , as if discovering a way through to the bitter end without a map .

spy-vs . -spy action flick with antonio banderas and lucy liu never comes together .
all the pieces fall together without much surprise , but little moments give it a boost .
dull , lifeless , and amateurishly assembled .
there's an audience for it , but it could have been funnier and more innocent .
the bottom line , at least in my opinion , is imposter makes a better short story than it does a film .

initially gripping , eventually cloying pow drama .
renner carries much of the film with a creepy and dead-on performance .
the acting by the over-25s lacks spark , with csokas particularly unconnected .
saved from being merely way-cool by a basic , credible compassion .
the cast delivers without sham the raw-nerved story .
griffin & co . manage to be spectacularly outrageous .
even if the enticing prospect of a lot of nubile young actors in a film about campus depravity didn't fade amid the deliberate , tiresome ugliness , it would be rendered tedious by avary's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest .
it's hard to imagine another director ever making his wife look so bad in a major movie .
this isn't even madonna's swept away . this is her blue lagoon .
for each chuckle there are at least 10 complete misses , many coming from the amazingly lifelike tara reid , whose acting skills are comparable to a cardboard cutout .
the pianist [is] a supremely hopeful cautionary tale of war's madness remembered that we , today , can prevent its tragic waste of life . here is a divine monument to a single man's struggle to regain his life , his dignity and his music .
the new faces are interesting , but the old story isn't , especially when it starts to seem more improvised than scripted .
the whole is quite entertaining , but despite its virtues , there is an unsettled feeling to the film .
a charming , quirky and leisurely paced scottish comedy -- except with an outrageous central gimmick that could have been a reject from monty python's meaning of life .
it helps that lil bow wow . . . tones down his pint-sized gangsta act to play someone who resembles a real kid .
this is a movie so insecure about its capacity to excite that it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action .
overall , it's a pretty mediocre family film .
as it abruptly crosscuts among the five friends , it fails to lend the characters' individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them .
about as satisfying and predictable as the fare at your local drive through .
an engrossing and infectiously enthusiastic documentary .
try as you might to scrutinize the ethics of kaufman's approach , somehow it all comes together to create a very compelling , sensitive , intelligent and almost cohesive piece of film entertainment .
if it's not entirely memorable , the movie is certainly easy to watch .
it's tough , astringent , darkly funny and . . . well , it's also generic , untidy , condescending and mild of impact rather than stunning .
as warm as it is wise , deftly setting off uproarious humor with an underlying seriousness that sneaks up on the viewer , providing an experience that is richer than anticipated .
uneven performances and a spotty script add up to a biting satire that has no teeth .
maybe thomas wolfe was right : you can't go home again .
the satire is just too easy to be genuinely satisfying .
it is a likable story , told with competence .
a generation x artifact , capturing a brief era of insanity in the sports arena that surely cannot last .
the first mistake , i suspect , is casting shatner as a legendary professor and kunis as a brilliant college student--where's pauly shore as the rocket scientist ?
constantly slips from the grasp of its maker .
it's consistently funny , in an irresistible junior-high way , and consistently free of any gag that would force you to give it a millisecond of thought .
show me the mugging .
i know that i'll never listen to marvin gaye or the supremes the same way again
scooby-doo doesn't know if it wants to be a retro-refitting exercise in campy recall for older fans or a silly , nickelodeon-esque kiddie flick .
straightforward and old-fashioned in the best possible senses of both those words , possession is a movie that puts itself squarely in the service of the lovers who inhabit it .

the film is hampered by its predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters .
jeong-hyang lee's film is deceptively simple , deeply satisfying .
every potential twist is telegraphed well in advance , every performance respectably muted ; the movie itself seems to have been made under the influence of rohypnol .
bottom-rung new jack city wannabe .
peralta's mythmaking could have used some informed , adult hindsight .
it's just hard to believe that a life like this can sound so dull .
[it's] a prison soccer movie starring charismatic tough guy vinnie jones , but it had too much spitting for me to enjoy .
a road trip that will get you thinking , 'are we there yet ? '
director rob marshall went out gunning to make a great one .
in this film we at least see a study in contrasts ; the wide range of one actor , and the limited range of a comedian .
the movie attempts to mine laughs from a genre -- the gangster/crime comedy -- that wore out its welcome with audiences several years ago , and its cutesy reliance on movie-specific cliches isn't exactly endearing .
simultaneously heartbreakingly beautiful and exquisitely sad .
feels like the grittiest movie that was ever made for the lifetime cable television network .
outer-space buffs might love this film , but others will find its pleasures intermittent .
it won't be long before you'll spy i spy at a video store near you .

barney has created a tour de force that is weird , wacky and wonderful .
stars matthew perry and elizabeth hurley illicit more than a chuckle , and more jokes land than crash , but ultimately serving sara doesn't distinguish itself from the herd .
the sentimental script has problems , but the actors pick up the slack .
twenty-three movies into a mostly magnificent directorial career , clint eastwood's efficiently minimalist style finally has failed him . big time .
sayles has a knack for casting , often resurrecting performers who rarely work in movies now . . . and drawing flavorful performances from bland actors .
there seems to be no clear path as to where the story's going , or how long it's going to take to get there .
cinematic pyrotechnics aside , the only thing avary seems to care about are mean giggles and pulchritude . it makes sense that he went back to school to check out the girls -- his film is a frat boy's idea of a good time .
a smart , steamy mix of road movie , coming-of-age story and political satire .
that rare documentary that incorporates so much of human experience -- drama , conflict , tears and surprise -- that it transcends the normal divisions between fiction and nonfiction film .
accuracy and realism are terrific , but if your film becomes boring , and your dialogue isn't smart , then you need to use more poetic license .
brosnan gives a portrayal as solid and as perfect as his outstanding performance as bond in die another day .
eventually arrives at its heart , as simple self-reflection meditation .
film can't quite maintain its initial momentum , but remains sporadically funny throughout .
an impressive debut for first-time writer-director mark romanek , especially considering his background is in music video .
a gracious , eloquent film that by its end offers a ray of hope to the refugees able to look ahead and resist living in a past forever lost .
a really funny fifteen-minute short stretched beyond its limits to fill an almost feature-length film .
it's one long bore .
it feels like very light errol morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs .
comes off like a rejected abc afterschool special , freshened up by the dunce of a screenwriting 101 class . . . . designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears , " crossroads " instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns .
i like my christmas movies with more elves and snow and less pimps and ho's .
it's an 88-minute highlight reel that's 86 minutes too long .
it's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic . unfortunately , that's precisely what arthur dong's family fundamentals does .
it treats women like idiots .
" the time machine " is a movie that has no interest in itself . it doesn't believe in itself , it has no sense of humorit's just plain bored .
terrific casting and solid execution give all three stories life .
surprisingly , the film is a hilarious adventure and i shamelessly enjoyed it .
as a belated nod to some neglected all-stars , standing in the shadows of motown is cultural history of the best kind : informative , revealing and richly entertaining .
mcconaughey's fun to watch , the dragons are okay , not much fire in the script .
as david letterman and the onion have proven , the worst of tragedies can be fertile sources of humor , but lawrence has only a fleeting grasp of how to develop them .

has it ever been possible to say that williams has truly inhabited a character ? it is now .

an imaginative comedy/thriller .
a moving and important film .
arliss howard's ambitious , moving , and adventurous directorial debut , big bad love , meets so many of the challenges it poses for itself that one can forgive the film its flaws .
definitely in the guilty pleasure b-movie category , reign of fire is so incredibly inane that it is laughingly enjoyable .
there are so few films about the plight of american indians in modern america that skins comes as a welcome , if downbeat , missive from a forgotten front .
thanks to the château's balance of whimsicality , narrative discipline and serious improvisation , almost every relationship and personality in the film yields surprises .
rabbit-proof fence will probably make you angry . but it will just as likely make you weep , and it will do so in a way that doesn't make you feel like a sucker .
resurrection has the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad blair witch project .
. . . better described as a ghost story gone badly awry .
the good thing -- the only good thing -- about extreme ops is that it's so inane that it gave me plenty of time to ponder my thanksgiving to-do list .
ultimately too repellent to fully endear itself to american art house audiences , but it is notable for its stylistic austerity and forcefulness .
the movie , directed by mick jackson , leaves no cliche unturned , from the predictable plot to the characters straight out of central casting .
jacquot's strategy allows his cast the benefit of being able to give full performances . . . while demonstrating vividly that the beauty and power of the opera reside primarily in the music itself .
cremaster 3 is at once a tough pill to swallow and a minor miracle of self-expression .
gangs , despite the gravity of its subject matter , is often as fun to watch as a good spaghetti western .

for its seriousness , high literary aspirations and stunning acting , the film can only be applauded .
despite its visual virtuosity , 'naqoyqatsi' is banal in its message and the choice of material to convey it .
damon brings the proper conviction to his role as [jason bourne] .
the beautifully choreographed kitchen ballet is simple but absorbing .
the leaping story line , shaped by director peter kosminsky into sharp slivers and cutting impressions , shows all the signs of rich detail condensed into a few evocative images and striking character traits .
by halfway through this picture i was beginning to hate it , and , of course , feeling guilty for it . . . . then , miracle of miracles , the movie does a flip-flop .
quiet , adult and just about more stately than any contemporary movie this year . . . a true study , a film with a questioning heart and mind that isn't afraid to admit it doesn't have all the answers .
a preposterous , prurient whodunit .
energetic and boldly provocative .
shot like a postcard and overacted with all the boozy self-indulgence that brings out the worst in otherwise talented actors . . .
includes too much obvious padding .
a fascinating glimpse into an insular world that gives the lie to many clichés and showcases a group of dedicated artists .
entertaining despite its one-joke premise with the thesis that women from venus and men from mars can indeed get together .
unflinchingly bleak and desperate
'sophisticated' viewers who refuse to admit that they don't like it will likely call it 'challenging' to their fellow sophisticates .
fails to satisfactorily exploit its gender politics , genre thrills or inherent humor .
irwin is so earnest that it's hard to resist his pleas to spare wildlife and respect their environs . there are far worse messages to teach a young audience , which will probably be perfectly happy with the sloppy slapstick comedy .
at some point , all this visual trickery stops being clever and devolves into flashy , vaguely silly overkill .
even if you're an agnostic carnivore , you can enjoy much of jonah simply , and gratefully , as laugh-out-loud lunacy with a pronounced monty pythonesque flavor .
a wildly entertaining scan of evans' career .
bravo reveals the true intent of her film by carefully selecting interview subjects who will construct a portrait of castro so predominantly charitable it can only be seen as propaganda .
the journey to the secret's eventual discovery is a separate adventure , and thrill enough .
an admitted egomaniac , evans is no hollywood villain , and yet this grating showcase almost makes you wish he'd gone the way of don simpson .
i can't quite recommend it -- it's too patched together -- but i almost can ; it's the kind of movie that makes you want to like it .
gets better after foster leaves that little room .
the filmmakers' eye for detail and the high standards of performance convey a strong sense of the girls' environment .
[t]here's only so much anyone can do with a florid , overplotted , anne rice rock 'n' roll vampire novel before the built-in silliness of the whole affair defeats them .
it's never dull and always looks good .
feature debuter d . j . caruso directs a crack ensemble cast , bringing screenwriter tony gayton's narcotics noir to life .
at a time when commercialism has squeezed the life out of whatever idealism american moviemaking ever had , godfrey reggio's career shines like a lonely beacon .
some actors steal scenes . tom green just gives them a bad odor . this self-infatuated goofball is far from the only thing wrong with the clumsy comedy stealing harvard , but he's the most obvious one .
a chilly , remote , emotionally distant piece . . . so dull that its tagline should be : 'in space , no one can hear you snore . '
it's an example of sophisticated , challenging filmmaking that stands , despite its noticeable lack of emotional heft , in welcome contrast to the indulgent dead-end experimentation of the director's previous full frontal .
the movie itself is far from disappointing , offering an original take on courtroom movies , a few nifty twists that are so crucial to the genre and another first-rate performance by top-billed star bruce willis .
aspires to the cracked lunacy of the adventures of buckaroo banzai , but thanks to an astonishingly witless script ends up more like the adventures of ford fairlane .
a gob of drivel so sickly sweet , even the eager consumers of moore's pasteurized ditties will retch it up like rancid crème brûlée .
elegant and eloquent [meditation] on death and that most elusive of passions , love .
it's the funniest american comedy since graffiti bridge .
seems like something american and european gay movies were doing 20 years ago .
kaufman and jonze take huge risks to ponder the whole notion of passion -- our desire as human beings for passion in our lives and the emptiness one feels when it is missing .
[raimi's] matured quite a bit with spider-man , even though it's one of the most plain white toast comic book films you'll ever see .
a work of extraordinary journalism , but it is also a work of deft and subtle poetry .
kaufman creates an eerie sense of not only being there at the time of these events but the very night matthew was killed .
there is nothing funny in this every-joke-has- been-told-a- thousand-times- before movie .
the sad thing about knockaround guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film isn't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is .
. . . if you're just in the mood for a fun -- but bad -- movie , you might want to catch freaks as a matinee .
the film contains no good jokes , no good scenes , barely a moment when carvey's saturday night live-honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment .
truly terrible .
one of the most genuinely sweet films to come along in quite some time .
there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening .
it's depressing to see how far herzog has fallen .
rich in detail , gorgeously shot and beautifully acted , les destinees is , in its quiet , epic way , daring , inventive and refreshingly unusual .
his work transcends the boy-meets-girl posturing of typical love stories .
spectacularly beautiful , not to mention mysterious , sensual , emotionally intense , and replete with virtuoso throat-singing .
equilibrium is what george orwell might have imagined had today's mood-altering drug therapy been envisioned by chemists in 1949 .
it provides an honest look at a community striving to anchor itself in new grounds .
'men in black ii creates a new threat for the mib , but recycles the same premise .
cold , nervy and memorable .
the stunt work is top-notch ; the dialogue and drama often food-spittingly funny .
it's too harsh to work as a piece of storytelling , but as an intellectual exercise -- an unpleasant debate that's been given the drive of a narrative and that's been acted out -- the believer is nothing less than a provocative piece of work .
overall , interesting as a documentary -- but not very imaxy .
" the road paved with good intentions leads to the video store "
barely manages for but a few seconds over its seemingly eternal running time to pique your interest , your imagination , your empathy or anything , really , save your disgust and your indifference .
unfortunately , neither sendak nor the directors are particularly engaging or articulate .
fresh and raw like a blown-out vein , narc takes a walking-dead , cop-flick subgenre and beats new life into it .
[while the last metro] was more melodramatic , confined to a single theater company and its strategies and deceptions , while tavernier is more concerned with the entire period of history .
a fascinating case study of flower-power liberation -- and the price that was paid for it .
the uneven movie does have its charms and its funny moments but not quite enough of them .
this is a film well worth seeing , talking and singing heads and all .
a gift to anyone who loves both dance and cinema
a low-key labor of love that strikes a very resonant chord .
there is only so much baked cardboard i need to chew .
the amazing film work is so convincing that by movies' end you'll swear you are wet in some places and feel sand creeping in others .
you may think you have figured out the con and the players in this debut film by argentine director fabian bielinsky , but while you were thinking someone made off with your wallet .
the effort is sincere and the results are honest , but the film is so bleak that it's hardly watchable .
the film may not hit as hard as some of the better drug-related pictures , but it still manages to get a few punches in .
even though it's common knowledge that park and his founding partner , yong kang , lost kozmo in the end , you can't help but get caught up in the thrill of the company's astonishing growth .
an artful , intelligent film that stays within the confines of a well-established genre .
with three excellent principal singers , a youthful and good-looking diva and tenor and richly handsome locations , it's enough to make you wish jacquot had left well enough alone and just filmed the opera without all these distortions of perspective .
depending upon your reaction to this movie , you may never again be able to look at a red felt sharpie pen without disgust , a thrill , or the giggles .
much monkeyfun for all .
new best friend's playboy-mansion presentation of college life is laugh-out-loud ludicrous .
not about scares but a mood in which an ominous , pervasive , and unknown threat lurks just below the proceedings and adds an almost constant mindset of suspense .
life on the rez is no picnic : this picture shows you why .
the soundtrack alone is worth the price of admission .
too slow , too long and too little happens .
why come up with something even quasi-original , when you can pillage from shirley jackson , richard matheson . . . and puke up something like rose red ?
effective but too-tepid biopic
arteta directs one of the best ensemble casts of the year
the whole thing's fairly lame , making it par for the course for disney sequels .
between them , de niro and murphy make showtime the most savory and hilarious guilty pleasure of many a recent movie season .
it's a movie that ends with truckzilla , for cryin' out loud . if that doesn't clue you in that something's horribly wrong , nothing will .
collateral damage is trash , but it earns extra points by acting as if it weren't .
. . . a trashy little bit of fluff stuffed with enjoyable performances and a bewildering sense of self-importance
though it inspires some ( out-of-field ) creative thought , the film is -- to its own detriment -- much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract .
with mcconaughey in an entirely irony-free zone and bale reduced mainly to batting his sensitive eyelids , there's not enough intelligence , wit or innovation on the screen to attract and sustain an older crowd .
a big , loud , bang-the-drum bore .
to build a feel-good fantasy around a vain dictator-madman is off-putting , to say the least , not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved .
what makes the movie special is its utter sincerity .
the main story . . . is compelling enough , but it's difficult to shrug off the annoyance of that chatty fish .
preaches to two completely different choirs at the same time , which is a pretty amazing accomplishment .
it may be a somewhat backhanded compliment to say that the film makes the viewer feel like the movie's various victimized audience members after a while , but it also happens to be the movie's most admirable quality
de niro cries . you'll cry for your money back .
to better understand why this didn't connect with me would require another viewing , and i won't be sitting through this one again . . . that in itself is commentary enough .
not so much funny as aggressively sitcom-cute , it's full of throwaway one-liners , not-quite jokes , and a determined tv amiability that allen personifies .
a derivative collection of horror and sci-fi cliches .
each punch seen through prison bars , the fights become not so much a struggle of man vs . man as brother-man vs . the man .
it's a stale , overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish . not only is entry number twenty the worst of the brosnan bunch , it's one of the worst of the entire franchise .
there are now two signs that m . night shyamalan's debut feature sucked up all he has to give to the mystic genres of cinema : unbreakable and signs .

an overly familiar scenario is made fresh by an intelligent screenplay and gripping performances in this low-budget , video-shot , debut indie effort .
like the best 60 minutes exposé , the film ( at 80 minutes ) is actually quite entertaining .
a vile , incoherent mess . . . a scummy ripoff of david cronenberg's brilliant 'videodrome . '
less cinematically powerful than quietly and deeply moving , which is powerful in itself .

a sharp , amusing study of the cult of celebrity .
the film is full of charm .
manages to be original , even though it rips off many of its ideas .
touché !
so boring that even its target audience talked all the way through it .
